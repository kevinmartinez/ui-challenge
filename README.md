# UI Developer Challenge

Steps:

I first created the basic markup, followed semantics. I like to work very visual, and working on my small screen mac always make me go for css quite early, so my first thought after the markup was to setup a browser refreshing tool like browser-sync, and also considered Gulp. But since a part of the challenge consists of Angular, i decided to set up the CSS there, (I will use Sass), and i have only worked with React and some other Frameworks/Libraries. I decided to go for the newest Angular. I tried the first verson of Angular a few years ago. I used the angular-cli and created a new app setup, and followed the docs and a guide on the Angular site. Since Angular use Webpack as it's build tool, which i think is more widely used nowadays, i could use this instead of using Gulp, but i would have used Gulp for a smaller project.
