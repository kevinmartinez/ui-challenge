# UI Developer Challenge

By: Kevin Martinez

### Created with Angular 5 / Angular CLI

`$npm install`

`$ng serve`

Brief

I first created the basic markup, followed semantics.
I like to work very visual, and working on my small screen mac always make me go for css quite early, so my first thought after the markup was to setup a browser refreshing tool like browser-sync, and also considered Gulp.

But since a part of the challenge consists of Angular, i decided to set up the CSS there, (I will use Sass), and i have only worked with React and some other Frameworks/Libraries. I decided to go for the newest Angular. I tried the first verson of Angular a few years ago.

I used the angular-cli and created a new app setup, and followed the docs and a guide on the Angular site. Since Angular use Webpack as it's build tool, which i think is more widely used nowadays, i could use this instead of using Gulp, but i would have used Gulp for a smaller project.

I have documented most of the work through comments, main folders i have worked with are
the: 'sass' folder, the 'app' folder. This project took me approx. 45 hours and included having to fight
quite a bit with Angular 5, and a lot with the CSS Grid fallbacks. I tested for x-browser with BrowserStack. I have access to this service through a friend and i found that the x-browser testing,
on a 'higher' level (i really tried to treat the project as "preparing it for a big team" in all aspects) the x-browser testing was a lot of fun, but almost the most challenging part.

This was a really fun challenge, i learned a lot of new things, refreshed my mind about a lot of things,
and also considered many new things. I hope you can get a good overview of my work, it's been hard a lot of times, but i feel confident with sending this in now.
