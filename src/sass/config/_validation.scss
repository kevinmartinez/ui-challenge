// Some of my form validators match the native inputs, but most
// Of them refers to Angulars validator classes, these classes are bound both to the native
// HTML attributes like "required"
// but is also it's own Angular validator API
// There were a lot of approaches to validating in latest Angular
// I would say that i think that the approach of Reactive Forms,
// And reactive driven Angular programming looks most appealing
// But i followed the docs and some of the official guides on the
// Angular site and tested Template driven Angular as well
// Form validating overall, (and form styling) is always a task
// So i settled for a few different easy approaches and tried to treat
// the whole project as an Angular project, thus needing to think a
// bit about other things then the validation with the time at hand.
// With more time i would have created more custom validations,,
// Both template driven and reactive style seem to have a lot of good
// options
// And made the whole form more "Modular", Also i see a possibility
// to use CSS/SCSS besides their js/ts/angular components, like
// in react when using Modular CSS
